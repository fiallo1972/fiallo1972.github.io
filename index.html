    <h1>Welcome To Heather's Programming Portfolio!</h1>
    
       <p> Welcome to my programming portfolio website! Here you will have the advantage of <br>
           going through my journey as I progress with my career in programming and coding. <br>
           I will try my best to make this website as original and as fun as possible with <br>
           my developing skills; as well as personalize it as much as I can to my style. This <br>
           <em>is</em> my first website ever using the HTML programming langauage or any other type of coding, <br>
           so <em>please</em> bear with me! I know that with much more practice, I <em>will</em> get better. <br>
           To learn more <a href="about.html">About Me</a>, feel free to look around and I hope you enjoy! </p>
