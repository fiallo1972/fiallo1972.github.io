    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> My name is Heather Tejeda-Fiallo and if you'd like to learn more about me, keep reading!<br>
        To start off, I am the middle child of three; I have a little sister and an older brother.<br>
        One of my favorite hobbies is art, which I usually use to let time go by and to express myself.<br>
        I have provided a few of my artwork that I created in high school; at first I was not the best,<br>
        but as time went by, I just kept getting better and better, which is hopefully what happens with<br>
        me and computer scince because software really caught my attention. </P>
    
    <p> Besides from being an artistic person, I also love to travel and going on adventures with my friends<br>
        and family. I have provided some pictures down below of some of the beautiful places I've been to.<br>
        Moreover, as a student at the University of Rhode Island, I am double-majoring in computer science and<br>
        Spanish with a minor in math. I am also involved in a couple of societies such as<br>
        SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers)and SLiC (Society of Latinx in Computing). </p>
